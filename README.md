file upload interface with a progress bar for tracking the processing state of the current file

It represents a file upload interface with a progress bar for tracking the processing state of the current file 

When the main “Upload” button is pressed, a modal window opens.
Selecting a note type from the drop down menu and adding a name, enables the “upload”  

Once a file has been uploaded the modal closes and the user sees a table of all processing files, with a progress bar representing the processing state of each task

Each processing task can be canceled with a delete button

Each progress bar updates with a fake timer. Different progress bars are independent from each other and their progress processes independently. When a bar reaches 100% it disappears from the list
